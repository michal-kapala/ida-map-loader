# IDA MAP loader

IDA 7 plugin for loading symbols from MSVC `.map` files.

Supports 64-bit offsets (see the issue on [mefistotelis/ida-pro-loadmap](https://github.com/mefistotelis/ida-pro-loadmap/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#known-issues)).

To install, put `maploader.py` in one of the IDA's `plugins` directories or link it through a `plugins.list` file.
